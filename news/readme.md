# FinVeda News and Analysis Feed

## Overview

The FinVeda News and Analysis Feed is a feature that provides users with real-time financial news and analysis. This feature integrates a Flask backend with a JavaScript frontend to fetch and display curated news articles from a reliable news API. Users can stay informed about the latest trends and events in the finance sector.

## Features

- Real-time fetching of financial news articles
- Filtered content based on relevant keywords
- Dynamic display of news articles with images, titles, and descriptions
- Responsive design for various devices

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: NewsAPI (or any other reliable news source)

## How It Works

1. **Backend**: The Flask application (`app.py`) serves as the backend for fetching news articles. It exposes an API endpoint (`/news-feed`) that retrieves articles from the news API based on specified keywords.

2. **Frontend**: The HTML file (`index.html`) contains a section where the news articles will be displayed. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) fetches the news data from the Flask API and dynamically updates the HTML to show the articles.

3. **Styling**: The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides basic styling for the news articles to enhance the user interface.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- A valid API key from a news API provider (e.g., NewsAPI)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinVeda.git
   cd FinVeda

2. Set Up the Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory.

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `news_api.py` with your actual API key.

3. Run the Flask Application:
```bash
python app.py

The Flask app will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4. Set Up the Frontend:

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
The news feed will automatically fetch and display the latest financial news articles.
